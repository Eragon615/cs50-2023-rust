# cs50-2023-rust
My wife is taking Harvard's cs50 course to learn programming. In order to encourage her and to also practice my rust, I'm going to follow along and perform each week's challenge but in Rust.

## Table of Contents
* [Links to Weeks](#links-to-weeks) - Links to the README.md files for each of the weeks' challenges.
* [Setting up this repo](#setting-up-this-repo) - How I set up this repo and thoughts on why.
* [Included Crates](#included-crates) - Crates I used in the challenges.

# Setting up this repo
I wanted to have all the weeks in the same repo, and to name the files similarly to cs50 so I avoided using `cargo new`. 

# Included Crates
These are the crates I used to complete challenges in some of the weeks' challenges.

| Crate Name | Version | Week(s) Used | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| example | x.x.x.x | 0 | I haven't had to use any yet, so this is an example |
